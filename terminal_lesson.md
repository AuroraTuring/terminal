1. How do you quickly open up your Terminal on your computer?

3. Working off the above question, how would you add a new file to the Projects directory called first_project.md?
cd projects 
touch first_project.md 

4. If you were in the Projects directory, what would you type to get back to the Turing directory?
cd ..

5. From your Turing directory, how would you view all the directories and files within that Turing directory?

cd turing
ls
